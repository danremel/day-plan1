#DayPlan

##Overview

For my final project, I decided to create an app that assists users with planning their days with the tasks they need to get done. The user simply creates an account, and creates a Day and Tasks that belong to that day. This allows the user to actually jot down what they need to get done when planning for special days in advance, such as an Anniversary, or a Birthday Party, etc.

##Technologies Used

* **Stack** - React on Rails

* **Languages Used** - HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and Ruby

* **Gems** - Devise, Omniauth, Devise_token_auth

* **Dependencies** - Axios, React-FontAwesome, React, React-Router-Dom, Styled-Components

##Future Development

* Bring in an external api that can augment the functionality of my application
